# Copilot Instructions for Webflow MCP

Whenever you are using Webflow's Model Context Protocol (MCP) and are about to modify specific things in a site, you must reference the files within the `.github/webflow/` directory. These files may contain important guidelines or requirements that need to be applied to the content you support or modify.

If requested to generate an seo strategy based on a specific site, FIRST try to find the site using Webflow's MCP, if you find it then ensure you follow the instructions in the `seo-strategy.md` file located in `.github/webflow/`.

For example, if you are working with rich text elements on Webflow, consult the `rich-text-docs.md` file in `.github/webflow/` for instructions on how to properly modify rich text content.

Always check for relevant documentation in `.github/webflow/` before making changes to ensure compliance with project-specific standards and practices.
